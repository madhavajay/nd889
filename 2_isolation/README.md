## Build a Game-Playing Agent

For the AIND Project 2: Build a Game-Playing Agent, we were introduced to the game Isolation and the concepts of Minimax search and Alpha-Beta pruning.

In addition we were asked to develop our own heuristics to attempt to beat the supplied heuristics.

## Instructions

Play against AI:
```bash
$ python play.py
```

Run tests:
```bash
$ pytest
```

Run genetic algorithm:
```bash
$ python pit.py
```
